**Predicting Match Outcomes from Early Game Statistics using Machine Learning**


![Project Banner](https://cdn1.epicgames.com/offer/24b9b5e323bc40eea252a10cdd3b2f10/EGS_LeagueofLegends_RiotGames_S1_2560x1440-47eb328eac5ddd63ebd096ded7d0d5ab)

## Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict League of Legends match outcomes based solely on statistics captured at the 10-minute mark. Using a dataset of **9,879 Diamond-tier ranked games**, I trained and evaluated five classification models achieving approximately **72% prediction accuracy**.

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression (L2 regularization)
- Logistic Regression (L1/Lasso)
- Decision Tree (GINI criterion)
- Random Forest (100 trees)
- SVM (RBF Kernel)
